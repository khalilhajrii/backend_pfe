- mongo's IDs are  wroten with _id 
  exmple: 
  user._id
  produit._id

:id in the url <-- means that's the id you need to pass in the front to back 
 exmmple 
   router.get(user/:id) <--- pass the user's id  --> user/4664656

:owner <---- pass to the id of the owner (product's owner  or demande's owner)
:cat  <--- pass the name of the categorie (phone / PC/ TV ....)
:nom <-- pass the product name (samsung s9/ iphone/ lg 7)

deleting an user will automatically delete all the products and the demandes that the user have but not the feedbacks

there's no upadate for a feedback or a categorie you just simply delete and add new one
